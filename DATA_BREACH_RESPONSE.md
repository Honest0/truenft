[General Security Procedures](#)

## Responsible Disclosure 

Any parties who suspect a vulnerability or data breach
should send an encrypted email to:

sam bacha <sam@freighttrust.com>
operations <admin@freighttrust.com>

## Sensitive Data 
The following is data that Freight Trust stores and considers
sensitive. If any such data becomes accessible to an unauthenticated /
unauthorized user, that will be considered a Data Breach:

Private repository contents (i.e. source code), whole or in "diff" form Private
user email addresses Any secrets or tokens which grant access to the above

> NOTE: Repository names, commit shas, Pull Request numbers, Pull Request
descriptions, and GitHub user or organization names are not considered sensitive
for the purposes of this response policy.

### Expectations In the event of a Data Breach,

All running services will be stopped to prevent further access Impacted users
will be notified by email within 24 hours, security@github.com will be notified
within 24 hours, along with any other vendors that may be affected.

### Non-Data-Breach Vulnerabilities  

Freight Trust routinely monitors for patched vulnerabilities in the software 
and infrastructure it depends on. Most such vulnerabilities are not at risk of
causing a Data Breach. In such cases, they will be patched without
user-notification or data-breach response activities. These are published
in our RSS Feed.
