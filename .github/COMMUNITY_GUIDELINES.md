# Freight Trust Open Source Community Guidelines

We encourage respectful behavior, this includes:

- Being considerate, constructive, and helpful.
- Not engaging in discriminatory, harassing, hateful, sexualized, or physically
  threatening behavior, speech, and imagery.
- Not engaging in unwanted physical contact.

## Resolve peacefully

We do not believe that all conflict is necessarily bad; healthy debate and
disagreement often yields positive results.

If you see someone behaving disrespectfully, you are encouraged to address the
behavior directly with those involved. Many issues can be resolved quickly and
easily, and this gives people more control over the outcome of their dispute. If
you are unable to resolve the matter for any reason, or if the behavior is
threatening or harassing, report it.

## Reporting problems

Some Freight Trust open source projects may adopt a project-specific code of
conduct. In those cases, a Freight Trust employee will be identified as the
Project Steward, who will receive and handle reports of code of conduct
violations. In the event that a project hasnâ€™t identified a Project Steward, you
can report problems by emailing corporate@freighttrust.com.

We may or mat not investigate every complaint, and you may not receive a direct
response. We will use our discretion in determining when and how to follow up on
reported incidents, which may range from not taking action to permanent
expulsion from the project and project-sponsored spaces. We will notify the
accused of the report and provide them an opportunity to discuss it before any
action is taken. The identity of the reporter will be omitted from the details
of the report supplied to the accused. In potentially harmful situations, such
as ongoing harassment or threats to anyone's safety, we may take action without
notice.
